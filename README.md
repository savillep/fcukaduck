# DuckDNS - roid edition

*A bit of overkill, but what the hell...*

The main reason to use this as opposed to the very clear and simple instx's
given at duckdns.org may be to prevent some un-necessary network traffic to 
their site.

1. Running the program the first time will create the directories and files.  
2. Add your specific url from the duckdns site to the config file seperated
by a space
3. setup on your timer of choice
